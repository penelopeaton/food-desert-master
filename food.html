  The exhausted 17-year old sat alone, only accompanied by four heavy plastic bags aboard a train for her 30-minute commute back home to the South Bronx. From the meat market in East Harlem, the round-trip took more than an hour, not including the walk she had to take from the Prospect Ave and Westchester Ave train station to her home, all while carrying the bags of irony smelling flesh: <q>it was terrible.</q> Her subway fare, travel time, cost of the fresh meat, in addition to her tiredness was all too much, but <blockquote><q>it’s just the hardship that comes with it, to just eat food.</q></p></blockquote>
  <p class="space"> Such a vital, strenuous journey was not uncommon, but it had to be taken for the privilege of fresh food.
  </p>
  <p class="space">Her neighborhood wasn’t entirely devoid of food, but substantial, healthy food was absent.</p>

  <p class="space">Distance is a significant inconvenience in the low income neighborhoods that food apartheid occurs in. Taking a cab to the local grocery store is not financially feasible, and the hassle of taking a bus or train isn’t cost effective at times. For some, grocery shopping is an essential task that gets done because it has to be. Most people see grocery shopping an annoying chore, but imagine if it was no longer a feasible option for getting food? Imagine if it was no longer a matter of choice.
  This was normal to her.</p>

  <p>Ariadne Vazquez found herself living in the heart of a food apartheid, which is more commonly known as food deserts: a Band-Aid term that glosses over the myriad of issues that come with racial and economic disparities.</p> <p class="space"> She and her mother lived in the South Bronx, where they faced hardships as their everyday realities. The two lived in low-income housing at one point they had a rat infestation. Her mother was terrified of rats, and her phobia intensified because of the infestation–as a result they had to buy a limited amount of food at a time. They had food: pandulce (sweet Mexican bread), tostones, platanos, and sometimes they ate steamed fish and vegetables from the Longwood Fish Market, which is <q>probably the healthiest food in that neighborhood.</q></p>

  <q>But, in the building I lived [in], everyone went through the same struggles… so we tried to have each other’s backs,</q> she recalls the time where her neighbor received her food stamps before her mom, and their neighbor cooked enchiladas for them when they didn’t have dinner. </p>
<p class="space"> Consequently, Vazquez began to feel the health complications that come with lack of food: <blockquote><q>I wasn’t working, and seriously there were days of just hunger.</q></blockquote> <p>After visiting a doctor, she realized she was malnourished, because she didn’t have a source of income, she was faced with the harsh reality of hunger: <q>It’s just, you can’t buy food, it’s just difficult.</q> </p>
<p class="space"> Vazquez found herself living in the heart of a food apartheid, which is more commonly known as food deserts: a Band-Aid term that glosses over the myriad of issues that come with racial and economic disparities.</p>
<p class="space"> In Vazquez’s previous neighborhood, District 17 of the South Bronx,  just steps away from Prospect Ave and Westchester Ave train station, the median household income averaged at $23,253 in 2015. Just 15 miles south on New School’s campus, 10011, the median household income averaged at $109,818—nearly eight times as more as the median household income of some South Bronx residents.

    In lieu of this financial inequality within food apartheids, food stamps are one alleviation to help those purchase food in times of hunger. Food stamps are given to people in poverty as way of helping them pay for their groceries. However, some people don’t have to use them as a main source of financing their food. In the South Bronx, this situation is quite different. Residents in poverty stricken areas rely on their food stamps to buy their groceries as well as hot food (though it is illegal.) <q>And another thing about being in that type of area, with bodegas, that my mom did and a lot of people did was- you go to the bodega, buy a couple things and say, ‘I’m sorry I can’t afford it right now, but I get my food stamp in two weeks,’ and they keep it as credit. So they’ll give you the food, but then when you get your food stamp, you go back and say, ‘Hey, I owe you… $20.’ And they take that $20 from you.</q> Bodegas are the central piece to getting their groceries because of their convenience and affordability. They even sometimes allow people to pay everything in food stamps.</p>
  <p class="space">Vazquez explains that for someone feeding a their family, a meal large enough to feed them would cost about $8. A dinner of tostones and fish would equate to $8, feeding a family for a day, but such a diet becomes expensive when one lives in a food apartheid, as it would cost $56 to feed a family that same meal for a week straight. This means the family would have the same one meal for seven days straight, not including purchasing other necessities such as toilet paper, toothpaste, etc. </p>

  <p class="space">$8 in a food apartheid can provide an entire meal for a family, but what does $8 get for those who live on the outside looking in? Living on $8 in Manhattan is an impossible task, but in the Bronx, it can get a full hot meal, <q>tostones, platanos, fish,</q> even rice and beans. Meals that can serve you more than once. What kind of dinner can you get for that price in The New School area? For one, everybody loves $1 pizza. It’s one of the best thing about being in New York. However, that only lasts on your stomach for an hour or two before you’re hungry again. The same goes for the fast food restaurants that are in close access for people to consume. Moving on to the hot meals that the beloved Whole Foods offers; for $8 you can get a bowl of pasta and maybe a piece of bread to accompany it. But how long with that last you? Does it warrant leftovers? How about Garden of Eden or Westside Market’s hot meals? A cup of soup or sandwich is within the budget, but nothing else to go along with it.

  These inequalities exist in a seemingly quiet manner, yet it is becoming more and more insidious each day—so why does hunger exist? Perhaps it is because there’s limited access to healthy eating. One solution would be to simply place a grocery store to make food accessibility easier, but that isn’t the case.

    <p>According to a study conducted by NYU, building grocery stores in areas affected by food apartheid is not the solution to eliminating this problem. Socioeconomic conditions as well as people’s shopping and eating habits take part.  If someone is used to eating a certain way because it was the only way that they could sustain themselves, they might not want to transition into a diet that is unfamiliar to them. Another layer to the issue is the cost difference of using food stamps at a bodega vs a grocery store. As Vazquez mentioned, you get more bang for your buck at bodegas because the owners are flexible with the way you can pay for your food. It’s the more feasible option. While adding the healthy grocery store to the area can eliminate the travel costs, it still does not make buying healthier foods any easier.</p>

  <p class="space"> The answer to hunger thriving in a food apartheid is complex, as racial, class, equity, and other factors contribute to such a question.</p>
  <p class="space"> Karen Washington has been striving to answer that question for over 20 years. An urban farmer and community activist, Washington has been growing her own food in <q>The Garden of Happiness</q> in for over 28 years. She is also an active member of Rise and Root Farm, and La Familia Verde Farmer’s Market in the Bronx According to La Familia Verde’s <a href="http://www.lafamiliaverde.org/about-us.html" target="_blank">website</a>, five community gardens (including <q>The Garden of Happiness</q>), volunteer to educate and empower both the public and policymakers to promote community change. </p>
  <p class="space">Washington, a James Beard Foundation Leadership Award recipient, moved to the Bronx in 1985, close to the Bronx Zoo. Three years later, the Garden of Happiness was born. For more than 20 years, she has been a catalyst for not only healthy eating and farming, but as an advocate and activist. She travels around the country and discusses social justice from a race and equity standpoint. Washington begins to break down the enormous difference between food desert and food apartheid. </p>
<p class="space"><q>Food desert is a term that we don’t use because it’s an <i>outsider term</i> used to sort of dictate what our neighborhood is all about. The premise around that term is that in low income neighborhoods, mostly neighborhoods of color, [is] that we don’t have food, and so the symbol is a desert. We tell people, we do have food. What we don’t have is access to healthy food. So instead of calling it a food desert, we like to use the term ‘food apartheid.’</q></p>
<p class="space"> Christopher Cook, author of <q>Diet for a Dead Planet: Big Business and the Coming Food Crisis</q> published a piece on CenterforJournalism.org. Titled, <q>Covering Food Deserts,</q> he <a href="https://www.centerforhealthjournalism.org/resources/lessons/covering-food-deserts" target="_blank">references</a> food justice advocate, Hank Herrera, who is also the President and CEO of the Popular Research, Education &amp; Policy (C-PREP). Herrera explains the controversy of the term food desert in Cook’s piece: explains, <blockquote>"Lack of access to fresh, healthy, affordable food result from structural inequities, deliberate public and private resource allocation decisions that exclude healthy from those communities."</blockquote><p>"That kind of inequity is food apartheid. The desert metaphor is inappropriate for conditions deliberately constructed by people. The desert metaphor only diverts attention from the inequitable, unjust condition."</q></p>



<p class="space">Food apartheids do not happen overnight. They are a result of systemic racial and economic disparities, specifically targeting low-income people of color. When looking at nearby locations from Vazquez’s home, the reality is clear: bodegas are abundant and healthy food options are absent in predominantly low-income neighborhoods–where a majority of the residents are people of color. For example, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief44.pdf">in 2014 the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene collected data</a> about food environments in the Crotona-Tremont (zip codes 10453, 1457, and 10460) areas of the South Bronx. </p>
<p>Out of 571 establishments, 46% of the businesses were bodegas, coming in second was fast-food restaurants at 19%. More than half of the bodegas readily advertised unhealthy eating options through displays and their checkouts, making poor options such as sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks highly accessible to their residents. Based on the information from the US Census, 66% of the population in the area were Hispanic, with 38% earning an income lower than the federal poverty level.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the question should not be of what are people who are affected by this doing to resolve the issue. Rather, it is about hunger, and why hunger thrives in food apartheids, which typically tend to be low-income, people of color.</p>
<p class="space">Initiatives have been taken by Bronx council members, <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/district-15/" target="_blank">Ritchie Torres</a> and <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/district-17/"Rafael Salamanca Jr.</a> Torres, a Democratic council member for District 15 of the Central Bronx allocated $10,000 in 2015 to <a href="http://www.nybg.org/green_up/" target="_blank">HealthBucks</a>, an organization that promotes healthy eating and living. HealthBucks encourages healthy eating at an affordable price; shoppers can pay for their fresh fruit and vegetables at Farmer’s Markets with their food stamps. Salamanca Jr., Vazquez’s council member for her old neighborhood (District 17) donated $10,000 to local Catholic charities to help with their Food Hub startup. This program provides up to 80,000 meals per month to all Bronx residents and upper Manhattan. Options are available: local community gardens striving to make changes, council members allocating funds towards healthy eating, organizations such as <a href="http://www.nybg.org/green_up/" target="_blank">Bronx Green-Up</a> partnering with the Bronx Zoo to provide healthy options to Bronx residents. But just because there are solutions does not mean hunger will go away overnight. Reaching out to your district’s council member to learn more about food and health policies within your neighborhood are vital to ignite change. Find your district and learn more about your council members <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/districts/" target="_blank">here,</a> and contact them with questions or concerns about the status of your neighborhood. Food apartheids are strategic and unnatural, and instead of proposing temporary solutions, it is more about asking why does hunger exist?
